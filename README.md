## Introduction adn Assumption

This project is the code Challenge of Myob to do a payroll system. It is deployed on Heroku and avaliable on URL: [https://payrollsystemmyob.herokuapp.com](https://payrollsystemmyob.herokuapp.com)

* The tax rate I'm using to generate tax is the newest one avaliable on ATO
* The system can only generate and pay the current calendar month's payslip (The version of can input the pay period is also avaliable)
* The date of pay period will always be the same day at the 28th of the month.
* The backend used moongoose Atlas as database, to make life easy, I put the URL straight away in the code. The right way is to put it in .env file

#### Install and run
You need to install Node.js to run the following script.

As this project has a server side and a client side, firstly, open a terminal and go to server file
#### `cd server`

Then install the node_modules
#### `npm install`

run the server, the server will run on port 5000
#### `npm start`

Then Open a New terminal window, and go to client file

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
